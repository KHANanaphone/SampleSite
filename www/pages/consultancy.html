                <h1>Business Continuity Management</h1>

<p>Disaster Recovery is considered both the bedrock and umbrella of any information security infrastructure at organizations. Business continuity management assures that all three aspects of security “CIA” (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) are maintained and in compliance with any security controls, latest technologies, policies and regulations. Enterprises must have a well-established disaster recovery plan to mitigate the risk of going out of business. </p>
<p>According to the Gartner Group, two out of five companies that experience a catastrophe, or an extended system outage, never resume operations; of those that do, one-third will go out of business within two years.</p>
<p>Failure in designing and implementing an effective Disaster Recovery Plan for medium size Canadian businesses will result in catastrophic size financial losses for such enterprises and thus a significant threat to their post-disaster sustainability. Company X consulting helps your business prepare for such disasters by providing business continuity frameworks designed and tailored to each industry, business size and budget. Company X uses COBIT 5, ITIL or ISO to map developed frameworks.</p>
